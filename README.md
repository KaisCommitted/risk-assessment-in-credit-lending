# Credit Default Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing the likelihood of credit default among clients based on various demographic and financial features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze the relationships between different factors to effectively predict whether a client will default on their credit payment in the next month.
